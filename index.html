    <h1>ISALs Portfolio Tracking Tool</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the ISALs Portfolio Tracking Tool project. This tool is designed to help NGOs empower rural women groups in Zimbabwe by tracking Internal Savings and Lending Schemes (ISALs).</p>
    <p>This project is free for NGOs, as it aims to bring meaningful impact to rural livelihoods and help organizations attract further funding through transparent tracking.</p>
